# Comps Tutorial Report, by Joshua Pulido

## Report
The report on the tutorial I used to learn about my comps project can be located within this repository, writtein LaTex. I've also provided a compiled pdf version, under main.pdf.

Additionally, the code for the tutorial can be found in this fork of the original tutorial's repository, at [this link](https://github.com/jacup101/OculusPassthroughDroneTutorialReport).
